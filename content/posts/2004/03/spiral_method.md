title: The Spiral Method for Writing Zeroth Drafts
---

One night in late December, as I was falling asleep, I had a thought about how to flesh out ideas for articles.  I sat up, grabbed a pen and an index card from the stack I keep next to the bed, and wrote:
<ol>
	<li>Write the nugget.</li>
	<li>Then write the implications of the nugget.</li>
	<li>Then support the nugget.</li>
</ol>
I was excited about this idea, because though I am quite good at inventing nuggets — the central claims that make me want to write articles in the first place — I struggle with the rest of the writing process, the process of growing a nugget into an article worth writing.  I keep forgetting the simple principles that every other author surely knows:  Say why this claim is worth reading, and justify the claim.  Writing those two simple principles gave me a way to remember, and a way to build articles from nuggets.

The next night, as I was falling asleep, I refined the previous night's thought:
<ol>
	<li>Write the nugget.</li>
	<li>Write any questions I want to ask about what I have written so far.</li>
	<li>Answer one question.  Return to step 2.</li>
</ol>
This new version generalizes on the first.  The earlier version says to ask and answer two questions: <em>So what?</em> and <em>What makes you so sure?</em>  The new version extends that to <em>any</em> question, giving me even more ways to build the article.  I liked this new version even better.

On the third night, as I was falling asleep, I refined again, resulting in a process that I call <strong>The Spiral Method for Writing Zeroth Drafts:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Write the nugget.</li>
	<li>Write any questions I want to ask about what I have written so far.</li>
	<li>Select the question that I have the most energy for answering, and answer it.  Return to step 2.</li>
	<li>Stop when I've answered all of the questions, or when I have little energy to answer any of the unanswered questions.</li>
</ol>
I liked this version better still, especially the focus on <em>energy</em> as the key criterion for what to write and when to stop.  Focusing on energy ensures that each bit I write not only supports the central idea, but also adds some zing.

So far, I've used the Spiral Method three times.  Each time, I created enough material for a full article (or two!) in about 30 minutes.  Next came hours of editing to shape each zeroth draft into publishable form.  The result: <a href="/posts/2004/03/spiral_experiences/">four articles and lots of surprises</a>.

Several days after I created the Spiral Method I realized that I'd been inspired by Mark Forster's process for <a href="http://www.markforster.net/index.php?view=47">growing an article</a>, which I'd learned about through Keith Ray's <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/keithray/blog/2003/11/index.html">blog entry of November 30</a>.  To grow an article, Mark writes a single sentence, then revises it until the article is done.

As you can see, both Mark's approach and mine start with a core idea and build outward.  The Spiral Method has a little more structure than Marks approach, and I find that I need that additional bit of structure.  <strong>Alternating between questions and answers, using my energy as a guide, keeps my ideas flowing, while providing lots of opportunity for discovery and surprise.</strong>

Though I developed the Spiral Method for myself, I'd be delighted to find that it works for you, too.  I'd be even more delighted to learn how you're using it.
