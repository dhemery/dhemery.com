title: Emery's Ironclad Test of Best Practices
---

<p> Before you try to sell me on some "best practice," I want you to know that I'll test it against <strong>Emery's Ironclad Test of Best Practices:</strong>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>For something to be a best practice, it has to be practiced, and it has to be best.</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p> If there ain't nobody practicing it, it ain't a best practice. </p>
<p> If it ain't best (and how would you <em>know</em> such a thing?), it ain't a best practice. </p>
<p> This is a simple enough test.  How many "best practices" pass it? </p>
