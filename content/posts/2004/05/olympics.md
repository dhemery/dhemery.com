title: 'Project Watch:  Olympic Stadium'
---

<p> However it turns out, the project to build the Olympic stadium for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens will make a great case study for students of project management. </p>
<p> Here are three news stories that give a hint about the status of the project: </p>
<ul>
<li>"<a href="http://www.reuters.com/printerFriendlyPopup.jhtml?type=topNews&amp;storyID=5036419">Greece Starts 100-Day Sprint as Games Loom Large</a>" (Reuters)</li>
<li>"<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=554&amp;u=/ap/20040504/ap_on_sp_ol/oly_athens_100_days_1&amp;printer=1">All Work, No Play 100 Days Before Olympics</a>" (Associated Press via Yahoo)</li>
<li>"<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/04/09/60minutes/main611169.shtml">Greece Behind In Summer Games</a>" (60 Minutes, CBS News)</li>
</ul>
<p> As I scan these stories, I notice these quotes: </p>
<blockquote>
<p> "In Greece, we are like â€˜Sirtaki' dance. We start very slowly, and then we speed up. And then at the end, you cannot even follow how quickly it goes. So I believe that's exactly what happened with us," says [Athens Mayor Dora] Bakoyanni. "We might be afraid until the last minute, but I believe that we will be ready in time." (60 Minutes) </p>
<p> "So, granted, there have been delays. And there's been inefficiency. Call it what you will," says [former foreign ministry official Alex] Rondos. "The fact is that, as we approach the Olympics, not unlike the condemned man approaching the guillotine, it concentrates the mind wonderfully. And we are there right now." (60 Minutes) </p>
<p> [Deputy culture minister in charge of the Games, Fani Palli-Petralia:] "We are working triple shifts everywhere and we will be ready." (Reuters) </p>
<p> Petralia said: "We are turning nightime into day and I am convinced the project will be ready and will be magnificent." (Reuters) </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Those quotes don't inspire confidence in me.  But what does the project's key customer, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), have to say? </p>
<blockquote>
<p> "Our experts who have reviewed these plans say, 'Yes, it's feasible. It can be done,'" [IOC overseer Denis] Oswald said. (Associated Press) </p>
<p> "All the reports I receive indicate how fast and how hard Greece is working to complete preparations," IOC president Jacques Rogge said. (Reuters) </p>
</blockquote>
<p> "Feasible" and "working fast and hard" don't have the ring of high confidence. </p>
<p> All of these quotes, from the IOC and from the project team, seem vague and non-committal.  I don't know whether that's because the people are saying only vague and non-committal things, or because the reporters are selecting only vague and non-committal quotes, or what.  Whatever the reason, these quotes smell funny. </p>
<p> The planned roof on the swimming stadium was scrapped weeks ago.  Anyone taking bets on the (as yet uninstalled) glass roof over the main stadium? </p>
<p> (As I write this, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/printerFriendlyPopup.jhtml?type=worldNews&amp;storyID=5042474">news comes from Reuters</a> of a series of three bombs exploding in Athens, near the hotel where Olympic officials will stay during the Games.) </p>
