title: Your Needs for Workshops about Power and Leadership
---

<p> I'm developing two workshops, one about leadership and another about power.  These workshops are for software people—developers, managers, executives, and others—and I'd like your input. </p>
<p> First imagine a leadership workshop.  In order for the workshop to be exceptionally valuable for you: </p>
<ul>
<li>What objectives or needs would the workshop address?</li>
<li>What kinds of situations would the workshop address?</li>
<li>What concepts would the workshop cover?</li>
</ul>
<p> Now imagine a workshop about increasing your power and using it wisely.  In order for the workshop to be exceptionally valuable for you: </p>
<ul>
<li>What objectives or needs would the workshop address?</li>
<li>What kinds of situations would the workshop address?</li>
<li>What concepts would the workshop cover?</li>
</ul>
<p> Finally, I have two more general questions: </p>
<ul>
<li>What other questions should I be asking?</li>
<li>What else do you want me to know as I develop these workshops?</li>
<li>Is there anything you want to ask me?</li>
</ul>
<p> Please let me know what you think, either through comments here or through email.  I will be grateful. </p>
