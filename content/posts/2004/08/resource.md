<strong>resource</strong>

<ol>
<li>
<em>n.</em>  Anything that can be used to create value.</li>
<li>
<em>n.</em>  Matter, energy, or information that can be transformed into more valued forms.</li>
<li>
<em>n.</em>  Knowledge, skills, or implements that can be used to transform other resources into more valued forms.</li>

<p> These definitions are strongly related to my definitions of <a href="/2004/08/technology/">technology</a>.  If I were feeling silly, I could plug these definitions of <em>resource</em> into my definition of <em>technology</em> to yield:  Technology is the application of resources to transform other resources into more valued forms.  Silly. </p>
<p> It feels to me as if the second and third definitions above omit something important: relationships.  Relationships are resources for the people involved.  I could add "relationships" to one or both lists, but they're already somewhat unwieldy. </p>
<p> What else is left out of this definition? </p>
<p> I'd like to find an evocative category to summarize the lists in the definitions.  What category summarizes matter, energy, and information?  What category summarizes knowledge, skills, and implements?  For now, I can't think of concise, evocative categories.  The word <em>anything</em> in the first definition certainly summarizes all of the other terms, but it's too general to be evocative. </p>
<p> Any adjustments I make here would likely ripple into my definition of technology. </p>
