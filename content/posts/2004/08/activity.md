title: Valuing Activity
---

<p> Here are some of the ways I may gain value from any given activity: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>I value having or using the product.</strong>  When I cook a pot of chili, I end up with a pot of chili that I can eat.  I like chili.</li>
<li>
<strong>I can exchange the product for something I value.</strong>  When I write software, I end up with a product that I can sell to a customer.  I like money.</li>
<li>
<strong>I enjoy doing the activity.</strong>  When I play my dale-o-caster guitar, or watch a movie, or read a book, I simply enjoy the activity itself.</li>
<li>
<strong>I value a side effect of the activity.</strong>  When I rub Lisa's feet, she is happy and relaxed.  I like that.</li>
<li>
<strong>I receive rewards for doing the activity.</strong>  When I present my ideas about leadership and resistance, people tell me how much they appreciate my ideas.  I like appreciation.</li>
</ul>
<p> Any activity that I choose to do is probably providing one or more of these kinds of value.  Any activity that other people are doing is probably providing one or more of these kinds of value.  <strong>If I want to persuade people to change what they're doing, I will probably need to take those sources of value into account</strong>: </p>
<ul>
<li>How can I replace the value people gain from what they're currently doing?</li>
<li>How can I increase the value people will gain from what I'm asking them to do?</li>
</ul>
