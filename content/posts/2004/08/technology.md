<p> I'm tempted to add <em>skills</em> to the list of things that can be applied as technology:  <em>The application of knowledge, skills, and objects...</em>  But that broadens the definition too much.  For example, <em>eating</em> would then fit the definition.  When I eat an apple, I apply my considerable eating skills to transform the apple into a more valuable form. </p>
<p> I'm also tempted to add <em>information</em> to the set of things that technology transforms into more useful forms.  Not tempted enough just yet, but tempted. </p>
