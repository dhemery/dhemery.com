<ol>
	<li> <em>n.</em>  The process of influencing a person using means that would be less effective if the person knew your intentions.</li>
</ol>
</dd> </dl> My definition relies heavily on descriptions I've read in two books.  In <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471548944/dalehemer-20">Influence without Authority</a></em>, Allan R. Cohen and David L. Bradford say, "influence attempts are not manipulative if you can tell your potential ally your intentions with no loss of influence."

Edgar Schein, in <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201067366/dalehemer-20">Process Consultation, Volume 1</a></em>, defines manipulation as "influencing others without making visible the motivation behind the influence attempts."

Each of these quotes suggests a test for whether your influence attempts are manipulative.  Cohen and Bradford's quote suggests what I call <strong><em>The Private Test of Manipulation:</em>  Could I tell the other person my intentions?</strong>

Schein's definition suggests the second, stronger test, which I call <strong><em>The Public Test of Manipulation:</em>  Have I told the other person my intentions?</strong>
