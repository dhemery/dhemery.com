title: Planning
---

<p> On the Agile Project Management mailing list, in the midst of an enthusiastic dialogue about the value of planning, <a href="http://www.clarkeching.com/">Clarke Ching</a> asked the clarifying and orienting question, "What is planning?" </p>
<p> My answer: </p>
<dl>
<dt>
<a>
<strong>plan</strong>
</a>
</dt>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>
<em>v.</em>  To select assumptions, expectations, constraints, intentions, and commitments to inform decisions about a course of action.</li>
<li>
<em>n.</em>  A description of a set of assumptions, expectations, constraints, intentions, and commitments selected to inform decisions about a course of action.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<p> Before Clarke asked, I didn't know that that's what I meant by planning.  That qualifies the question as a <a href="/posts/2003/09/good_questions/">good one</a>. </p>
<p> [Update 4:55 PM:  Added "intentions."] </p>
