title: Permission to Help
---

<p>
<strong>One of the most important elements of a helping relationship is permission to help.</strong>  This applies to all kinds of helping relationships: coaching, consulting, teaching, psychological counseling, medical practice.  If you don't give me permission to help you, it's dangerous for me to imagine that we have a helping relationship at all. </p>
<p> I've learned that if I am to help someone, I must first secure the person's permission to help.  That's easy when someone asks for help.  But what about if someone simply describes a frustrating problem?  Is that a request for help?  I say no.  I've learned that permission must be explicit, and must be continually renegotiated after it's given, because: </p>
<ul>
<li>Your experiencing pain does not necessarily mean that you see the pain as a problem.</li>
<li>Your having a problem does not necessarily mean that you want help.</li>
<li>Your wanting help does not necessarily mean that you want <em>my</em> help.</li>
<li>Your wanting my help does not necessarily mean that you want my help <em>right now</em>.</li>
<li>Your wanting my help does not necessarily mean that you want the kind of help I'm offering.</li>
<li>Your wanting my help right now does not necessarily mean that you will want my help tomorrow, or three minutes from now.</li>
</ul>
<p> If I want to help, I must repeatedly make sure I have your permission at all of these levels. </p>
