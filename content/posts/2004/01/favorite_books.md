<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0071401946/dalehemer-20">Crucial Conversations: Tools for Talking When the Stakes are High</a>
</em>          by Kerry Patterson, Joseph Grenny, Ron McMillan, and Al Switzler.     </strong>
</dt>
<dd>     As you can see from the list of books below,     over the past year     I've been a student of conversation and relationships.     I've been especially interested     in how we can make our conversations     more rewarding     for ourselves,     for others,     and for our relationships.     <em>Crucial Conversations</em>     helped me to make a big leap     in that direction,     and that's why it is     <strong>     my favorite book of 2003.     </strong>     [<a href="/2004/01/crucial_conversations/">Full Review</a>] </dd>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670883395/dalehemer-20">Difficult Conversations: How to Discuss What Matters Most</a>
</em>          by Douglas Stone, Bruce Patton, and Sheila Heen.     </strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<em>Difficult Conversations</em>     shows that any conversation that matters     is really <em>three</em> conversations:     one about what happened,     another about how we feel about what happened,     and a third     about how all of that     affects the way we think of ourselves.     When we try to talk about all of these important things at once,     each conversation confuses the other,     and we derail the overall conversation. </dd>
<dd>The second half of the book     describes how to conduct a <em>learning conversation,</em>     a conversation in which we learn the other person's story,     express our views and feelings fully,     and solve problems together.     These ideas are very similar     to the concepts     in <em>Crucial Conversations</em>     of dialogue and the "shared pool of meaning,"     and also to the approach I describe     in my articles     "<a href="http://dhemery.com/articles/resistance_as_a_resource/">Resistance as a Resource</a>"     and     "<a href="http://dhemery.com/articles/untangling_communication/">Untangling Communication</a>." </dd>
<dd>
<em>Difficult Conversations</em>     and     <em>Crucial Conversations</em>     complement each other nicely.     The books cover similar content,     and express compatible ideas     about how to make challenging conversations work. </dd>

Also enlightening for me     was the chapter about     helpful questions. </dd>
