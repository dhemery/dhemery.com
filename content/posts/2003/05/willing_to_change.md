title: Willing to Change
---

<p> On the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MasteringProjectWork">Mastering Project Work</a> mailing list, <a href="http://www.projectcommunity.com/whoweare.html">Amy Schwab</a> offered <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MasteringProjectWork/message/59">this nice quotation</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p> "A teacher of dialogue put it this way, 'You are only listening to the extent that you are willing to be changed by the conversation.'" </p>
</blockquote>
<p> This lovely idea helps me to understand an important element of resistance. When I interpret another person's actions as resistance, that's a signal that I am listening from a fixed perspective, a perspective in which my goal is to influence the <em>other</em> person to change. Interpreting the actions as resistance separates me from the other person's point of view, and reinforces my own. This reinforcement is not just the <em>outcome</em> of using the word resistance; it is the <em>purpose</em>. I call the person's actions resistance in order to hold onto my goal, in order not to change. <strong>I call another's actions resistance in order to resist being changed.</strong>
</p>
<p> When I define my goal as influencing another person to change, I limit my options. Holding tightly to this goal leaves me with only one way to get what I want: The other person must change. </p>
<p> If I am willing to listen fully to the other person, <strong>if I am willing to be changed, I open up new possibilities for resolving "resistance."</strong> For example, I may learn new information that shows that the change I am promoting is not such a good idea after all. I may discover that the change includes some element that is unimportant to me, but creates a big problem for the other person, and that a simple adjustment would eliminate the problem. Or the other person may offer an idea that is even better than the one I was promoting. Or the two of us may create new ideas together, ideas that satisfy both of us. </p>
<p> In each of these cases, the "resistance" vanishes. Each of these happy outcomes is possible only if I am willing to allow myself to be changed. </p>
<p>
<strong>Experiment:</strong> Recall a recent experience in which someone resisted your proposal or request. How important was it for you to influence the other person to change? What made that so important to you? </p>
