title: Risk and Commitment
---

<p> The SEPG Conference in Boston in 1995 had a bookstore. One of the books I browsed offered an idea about risk â€” something like, <strong> "Risk comes from commitment." </strong>
</p>
<p> I don't remember anything else about the book, but that idea stayed with me. Before that moment, most of what I'd read about risk focused on <em>uncertainty</em> as the defining quality that characterizes risk. That quote helped me to see that uncertainty, all by itself, isn't enough to constitute risk. <strong> A possible event is a risk event only if it jeopardizes a commitment. </strong> For example, suppose I am working on a project, and I am wildly uncertain about when I will finish. Does my uncertainty constitute risk? Only if I have committed to finishing by a certain time. If I haven't made any commitments about when I will finish, my uncertainty is not a risk. It's just uncertainty. </p>
<p> I've used this relationship between risk and commitment to help projects in a number of ways: to identify risks, and to identify commitments that have not been made explicit. </p>
<p>
<strong> Experiment: Use commitments to identify risks. </strong> Write down every commitment your project has made. For each commitment, ask, "What could happen that would jeopardize this commitment?" Your answers tell you your most important project risks. </p>
<p>
<strong> Experiment: Use risks to identify commitments. </strong> Brainstorm a list of project risks. For each risk, ask, "What would happen if this risk occurred?" and "What outcome would this risk jeopardize?" The answers identify outcomes that <em>someone</em> thinks are important either to achieve or to prevent. Explicitly negotiate whether to commit to those outcomes. Then communicate your decisions to the affected project stakeholders. </p>
<p>
<strong>PS.</strong> I don't remember the name of the book from which I got the quote about risk and commitment. If you know the source of the quote, please let me know. I think that the quote is from the introduction or an early chapter, and that the author (or authors) worked at IBM. </p>
