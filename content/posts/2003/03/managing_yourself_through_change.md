title: Managing Yourself Through Change
---

My <a href="/articles/managing_yourself_through_change/">Managing Yourself Through Change</a> article continues to be the most popular article on my web site.  Some people have asked to use it in their classes.  Just recently, <a href="http://www.mentorshiponline.com">MentorshipOnline.com</a> asked to publish the article on their site (see the <a href="http://www.mentorshiponline.com/cat.list.asp?cid=19&amp;section=learning&amp;cat=artlearncat">Communications &amp; Leadership</a> section in their <a href="http://www.mentorshiponline.com/articles.learning.asp">Learning Center</a>.) </p>
<p> I'm not sure what makes this article so popular.  Perhaps it's because many people are experiencing major change lately (e.g., terrorist attacks, job loss, economic slowdown). I suspect it gets a big boost from the link on <a href="http://www.geraldmweinberg.com">Jerry Weinberg</a>'s site (thank you, Jerry!). And one day when <a href="http://www.threeriversinstitute.org/id18.htm">Kent Beck</a> dropped a nice comment about the article in the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/extremeprogramming">Extreme Programming Yahoo! Group</a>, 300 people visited my site to see what he was so enthusiastic about (thank you, Kent!). </p>
<p> However you find my articles, welcome! </p>
