title: Don't Be Nice, Be Real
---

<p> Through several recent conversations on the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/resistance-as-a-resource">Resistance as a Resource mailing list</a> and other places, I've realized that I've written little about <strong>two enormously important factors that affect resistance: emotions and relationships.</strong> My article "<a href="/articles/resistance_as_a_resource/">Resistance as a Resource</a>" barely mentions emotions and feelings, and offers only a few ideas about improving your relationships with the people you are asking to change. Emotions and relationships are two key areas in which I want to improve my approach to resistance. </p>
<p> My first improvement is to highly recommend the book  <em>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0972002804/dalehemer-20">Don't Be Nice, Be Real</a>
</em>, by Kelly Bryson. I'll leave it to you to discover why Bryson recommends against being "nice" (those quotes around "nice" are a clue). I want to focus on just one of several important themes that run through the book: <em>empathy</em>. The theme of empathy weaves together the threads of emotions, values, needs, and relationships. </p>
<p> When you're responding to resistance, relationships matter a great deal. Your relationship with each person affects how you and the person interpret each other's words and actions. When you change your relationship, you change the conversation. </p>
<p> Bryson offers this idea about changing your relationships: </p>
<blockquote>
<p> If I can change my image of you, you cannot help but change your image of me. (p 196) </p>
</blockquote>
<p> So how can I change my image of another person? One way is to explore the needs behind the person's actions and to empathize with the needs. </p>
<blockquote>
<p> Almost all the power to inspire compassion comes from expressing the need, and only a little from expressing the feeling. Also when I am listening to someone, it is much more powerful to demonstrate that I understand the other's need than it is to just show that I have heard their feeling. (p 99) </p>
</blockquote>
<p> When Bryson talks about needs, he is talking not about specific behaviors or results that one person might want from another, but about <em>universal human needs,</em> such as honesty, connection, peace, physical wellbeing, autonomy, play, and meaning. (For a more detailed list of needs, see the <a href="http://www.cnvc.org/needs.htm">Needs Inventory</a> on the <a href="http://www.cnvc.org">Center for Nonviolent Communication</a> web site.) </p>
<p> Resistance expresses needs. If I can understand the universal human need that someone is expressing through resistance, I can empathize with it. And <strong>if I can express my empathy for the person's needs, I've taken a big step toward creating a relationship that supports trust, respect, communication, and collaboration.</strong>
</p>
<p> How can you understand the needs that people are expressing through their resistance? My articles "<a href="/articles/resistance_as_a_resource/">Resistance as a Resource</a>" and "<a href="/articles/untangling_communication/">Untangling Communication</a>" give many ideas about that. Bryson offers an additional idea: guess. </p>
<blockquote>
<p> You do not have to guess right. Just guess human. Just imagine a human feeling and need that might be behind their words. Guessing feelings and needs at least puts us in the camp of humanness, instead of judgment. (p 122) </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The main focus of my "<a href="/articles/resistance_as_a_resource/">Resistance as a Resource</a>" article is <em>understanding</em> the other person's point of view. Bryson has helped me to see that <strong>we can do even better than understanding. We can <em>empathize</em>.</strong>
