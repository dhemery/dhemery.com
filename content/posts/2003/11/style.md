Of all the books in <a href="/posts/2003/11/books_about_writing/">my writing library</a>, Joseph M. Williams's  <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321095170/dalehemer-20">Style: Ten Lessons in Clarity and Grace</a></em>,  helped me to make the biggest leap in the quality of my writing. Williams focuses on how our choices of words, and our choices for arranging our words, affect readers. One key idea is that readers they expect to find certain kinds of information in specific places, and that if we revise our writing to better fit those expectations, our writing will be clearer and more coherent.

For example, readers expect sentences to begin with familiar information, and to end with information that is newer. Also, readers look to the ends of phrases and sentences for information that is more significant. So <strong> we can make our writing clearer by shifting familiar, less important information to the beginnings of our sentences, and shifting newer, more important information to the ends. </strong> By applying this one tip, I improved both my writing and my <em>confidence</em> that I can write well.

<em>Style</em> and Elbow and Belanoff's <em><a href="/posts/2003/11/being_a_writer/">Being a Writer</a> </em>are my two favorite books about writing. While <em>Being a Writer</em> focuses on the writing process, <em>Style</em> focuses on structure and content. The techniques I learned from each book gave me not only the skill to write, but also the confidence to write.

Williams has also written  <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321112520/dalehemer-20">Style: The Basics of Clarity and Grace</a></em>,  a shorter version of <em>Style</em> that makes a handy reference book.
