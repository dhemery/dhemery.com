title: Plan for the Present
---

<p> Laurent Bossavit asks a great question, <a href="http://bossavit.com/thoughts/archives/000670.html">"What is the purpose of planning?"</a>. He then gives examples of two of the most common purposes: to facilitate completing the project by some significant date or event, or to facilitate predicting the budget. I like Laurent's question, and encourage you to ask it before (or during, or after) you engage in any significant planning. </p>
<p> "What is the purpose of planning?" is a form of <a href="/2003/06/the_value_question/">The Value Question</a>. However you answer the question, whatever your purpose for planning, your answer expresses a belief that planning will achieve that purpose. I want to explore that belief by asking another question: How will planning achieve that purpose? How, for example, will planning help you to complete the project by a significant date? How will planning help you to predict the budget? </p>
<p> Planning helps you do those things by making explicit your thoughts about what resources you will apply and what will happen as a result. <strong> Planning exposes your commitments, expectations, and assumptions, </strong> and allows you and other people to explore them, to test them, to assess your confidence in them. </p>
<p> Whether your expressed purpose for planning is to help you meet a committed date, or to predict your budget, or some other purpose, <strong> planning always has this intermediate purpose: to communicate our present commitments, expectations, and assumptions about the project. </strong>
</p>
<p> One implication of this purpose is that <strong> though planning seems to be about the future, it is, ultimately, entirely about the present, </strong> about what we are expecting, assuming, and committing to <em>right now.</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Experiment:</strong> The next time you plan, make this intermediate purpose explicit: to communicate and examine our present commitments, expectations, and assumptions about the project. </p>
<p>
<strong>Experiment:</strong> If planning is entirely about the present, about the commitments, expectations, and assumptions you hold <em>right now,</em> what information becomes more important to your planning? What information becomes less important? </p>
<p>
<strong>Experiment:</strong> If planning is entirely about the present, how does that affect the way you treat the plan as the project progresses? </p>
