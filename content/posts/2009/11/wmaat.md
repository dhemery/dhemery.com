title: Writing Maintainable Automated Acceptance Tests
---

I've posted "<a href="http://dhemery.com/pdf/writing_maintainable_automated_acceptance_tests.pdf">Writing Maintainable Automated Acceptance Tes</a>ts" on my <a href="http://dhemery.com/articles">articles page</a>.

The article demonstrates how to make automated acceptance tests more maintainable by:
<ul>
	<li>Hiding incidental details</li>
	<li>Eliminating duplication</li>
	<li>Naming essential ideas</li>
</ul>

Though the examples in the article use a very nice testing framework called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/robotframework/">Robot Framework</a>, the ideas work just as well with other other popular open-source testing frameworks, such as <a href="http://fitnesse.org/">FitNesse</a> and <a href="http://cukes.info">Cucumber</a>.

You will be able to follow the article even if you don't know Robot Framework. But don't be surprised if it inspires you to give Robot Framework a try.
