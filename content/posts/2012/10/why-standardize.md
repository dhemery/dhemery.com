title: Standardize Practices to Aid Moving People Around?
---

Often as I’m working with an organization,
managers and executives want to standardize new practices
even before they have tried them.
When I ask what standardizing will do for them,
they say,
“It will allow us to move people easily from one project to another.”

This puzzles me, for three reasons.

First,
I haven’t seen organizations move people
from project to project very often.
Even if standardizing helps move people around,
you won’t get that benefit
if you don’t actually move people around.

Second,
I don’t know whether “standardizing practices”
helps move people from project to project.
I’m not saying it doesn’t help.
I’m saying that I don’t know.

Third,
I’m not sure whether “standardizing practices”
actually standardizes the practices in any meaningful way.

Given all of this,
I suspect that “allowing us to move people around”
is not the real reason for standardizing.
If I’m right about that,
what might the real reasons be?
