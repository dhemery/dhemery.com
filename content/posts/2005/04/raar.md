title: The Resistance as a Resource Game
---

Here's a new game I've invented, called ***The Resistance as a Resource Game.***

**Objective.**
To create, learn, remember, and express ideas about how to respond to resistance.

**Where to Play.**
The game can be played anywhere that ideas can be posted,
such as mailing lists,
electronic forums,
and conference rooms with walls, white boards, or flip charts.

**Players.**
Any number of players can play.

**Turns.**
It is always your turn.

**Moves.**
There are four kinds of moves:

1. **Change.**
  _Post an example of change that you are promoting._
1. **"Resistance."**
  Choose one of the posted examples of change, and _post an example of a statement that expresses "resistance" to that change._
1. **Reason.**
  Choose one of the posted examples of "resistance,"
  and _post an example of a reason
  that an intelligent, competent, sincere person of good will might say such a thing._ 
  My article ["Resistance as a Resource](http://dhemery.com/articles/resistance_as_a_resource/)
  might give you ideas for this move.
1. **Response.**
  Choose one of the posted reasons,
  and _post an idea about how to respond effectively to someone who has that reason for making that statement._
