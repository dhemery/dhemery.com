title: Bob and Dale Chat about Social Challenges at Work
---

<p>A few weeks ago, at Agile Development Practices West 2010 conference in Las Vegas, my friend and colleague <a href="http://electroglide.biz/">Bob Payne</a> hosted me for an episode of his Agile Toolkit podcast. I invite you to listen to <a href="http://bit.ly/cQFhIW">our half-hour conversation</a> and to <a href="http://agiletoolkit.libsyn.com/">other episodes</a> about all things Agile.</p>

<p>Bob's podcasts are always conversational&#8212;the conversation wanders where it will, but seldom strays far from the topic du jour. Our wanderings touched on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Resistance is mutual</li>
<li>Bridging the gap between hamsters and wolverines</li>
<li>Solving the deeper problem is sometimes easier than solving the surface problem</li>
<li>Ineffective patterns of coping with stress (blaming, placating, distracting)</li>
<li>Joe diffuses the boss's boss's boss's boss's boss's blaming</li>
<li><a href="/posts/2004/04/aggregation/">The power of aggregation</a></li>
<li>The power of giving yourself choices</li>
<li><a href="http://catalysisgroup.com">Payson Hall's</a> terrific keynote about the dilemmas of risk management</li>
<li>Dale fails to grok space and time</li>
<li>Three definitions of resistance</li>
<li><em>Overcoming</em> resistance (boo!) versus <em>resolving</em> resistance (yay!)</li>
<li><a href="http://dhemery.com/articles/resistance_as_a_resource/">Resistance is feedback</a></li>
<li>To encourage change, start by <a href="/posts/2003/05/meet_people_where_they_are/">meeting people where they are</a></li>
<li>Two styles of Agile adoption: "By the book" and evolutionary</li>
<li>From balance to differentiation&#8212;from "how much" to "which"</li>
<li>My upcoming <a href="http://bit.ly/cUcxGx">Resistance as a Resource</a> workshop at <a href="http://agilistry.com">Agilistry Studio</a>, July 14&#8211;15</li>
</ul>

<p>Only in retrospect could I name the central topic of our chat: social challenges at work. In further retrospect, that central topic is nearly inevitable, given my interests.</p>
