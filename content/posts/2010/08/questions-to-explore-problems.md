title: Questions to Explore Problems
---

One of the most powerful things you can do
to help someone solve a problem
is to ask great questions.
My new article
["Questions to Explore Problems"](http://dhemery.com/pdf/questions_to_explore_problems.pdf) (PDF)
gives dozens of questions
that Iâ€™ve found essential in my work as a coach,
including questions to explore:

- The problem in general.
- The desired state, the perceived state, and the difference between the two.
- The way the problem is stated.
- The problem's past, present, and future.
- The way the problem is being solved.
- The way you are exploring the problem.
