title: Emery's Law
---

>   **Emery's Law:**
    Any social phenomenon is more complex than you imagine,
    even when you take into account Emery's Law.

By *any,* I mean phenomena like:

-   The riots in Baltimore in the Spring of 2015.
-   Police treatment of individuals.
-   Distribution of privilege.
-   Compensation schemes.
-   Testing.
-   Estimating.
-   A stream of comments on Youtube, Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, ...
-   Steve Earle's concert at the Crest Theater in Sacramento
    on April 29, 2015.
-   A kiss.
-   A shared glance.
-   This blog post.
-   The woefully limited range of categories
    I was able to think of
    as I constructed this list.

One implication of Emery's Law:
Your understanding of any social phenomenon is incomplete.

My advice:
Whatever conclusions you draw about any social phenomenon,
no matter how simple it seems,
hold them tentatively.
