title: What Questions Do You Have About Resistance?
---

I'd like your help to help guide my energy as I <a href="/posts/2006/10/danofiwrimo/">write during October</a>.  I'm more motivated when I know I'm writing about something that real people care about.  So I'd like to know <strong>What questions do you have about resistance?</strong>

You can either post your questions here or send them to me <a href="/">by email</a>.  I'll do my best to answer your questions here at  <em><a href="/posts/">Conversations with Dale</a>,</em> or in the book, or by email, or by some combination.

If you stumble upon this post after October, even years after, I'd still like to hear your questions about resistance, because whatever I write in October will be just the beginning.
