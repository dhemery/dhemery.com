title: DaNoFiWriMo
---

Several years ago,
[ChrisBaty](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0811845052/104-3420659-4046314?tag=dalehemer-20)
and some of his insane friends created the National Novel Writing Month,
or [NaNoWriMo](http://www.nanowrimo.org/).
The idea is to write a 50,000 word novel in the month of November.
Many people use the month to create what
[Anne Lamott calls](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0811845052/104-3420659-4046314?tag=dalehemer-20)
"a shitty first draft,"
and then use the following year to rewrite the draft into a passable novel.

This year I want to do something similar,
but with non-fiction.
I'm tempted to call it NaNoFiWriMo,
or National Non-Fiction Writing Month,
but I'm refraining for two reasons.
First,
[at least two other people](http://www.google.com/search?q=nanofiwrimo) already thought of that.
Second,
I don't care whether this goes national;
I'm doing it for myself.

So I'm calling it Dale's Non-Fiction Writing Month, or DaNoFiWriMo.
I've chosen October for my first DaNoFiWriMo,
because for the first time in years
I have a whole month with no scheduled training or consulting.

Part of the NaNoWriMo process is making a public commitment.
I hate that.
But I hate it less now than I will three days from now,
so here goes:
**I will write a 50,000 word draft of a non-fiction book in October, 2006.**
I'll let you guess the topic.

Do we still switch to standard time in October?
I could use the extra hour.
