</dd> </dl><!--more--> <strong>Outcome.</strong>  People sometimes talk about a role in a process, which focuses on the process as the context for the role.  This gives process more emphasis than I like, and can give the impression that process is the goal.  My definition emphasizes <em>outcome</em>.  This reminds me that it's ultimately the outcome, and our desire for that outcome, that motivates the role.

<strong>Shared.</strong>  I considered dropping the word <em>shared</em> from the definition.  I decided to retain it because when people talk about roles, it's almost always in the context of an outcome to which many agents have contributed.

<strong>Single, identifiable agent.</strong>  The agent may be a single person, an group of people, or some other, non-human contributor.

<strong>Cohesive.</strong>  This means that the contributions share some essential quality.  This word focuses on what is contributed, not on who makes the contribution.
