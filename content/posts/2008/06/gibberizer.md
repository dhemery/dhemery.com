title: 'Introducing Gibberizer: Automated Gibberish'
---

I've created a mostly goofy software tool called Gibberizer.  You enter some text into Gibberizer, and it produces gibberish that is somewhat similar to your text.

Mostly the thing is just goofy fun. I've spent several hours gibberizing The Gettysburg Address into nearly-meaningful nonsense that sounds like Honest Abe on smack.  If that ain't fun, I don't know what is!

But there's a potentially useful application for Gibberizer.  Fantasy and Science Fiction writers working in invented worlds and cultures can use it to invent names for people, places, and things.  <strong>Given a list of names from a culture, Gibberizer will invent other names that seem, more or less, to come from the same culture.</strong>

For example, I entered a list of 50 names from <em>Lord of the Rings</em> into Gibberizer, and it created these 25 "similar" names:  <em>Fimbreth Nimrodo Maggins Galad Peregolas Fladriel Nimroden Theodel Bregrin Elladriel Elladrif Fladan Elberegalad Pereth Halbaramir Boromiel Farad Beregalad Baggot Froden Beregrin Bregolas Bregond Brandalf Bereth.</em>   Most of those names fit the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> culture.

I'm making Gibberizer available for free for any use whatsoever.

You can <strong>download Gibberizer</strong> at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gibberizer/">The Gibberizer Project Page</a>.<a href="http://code.google.com/p/gibberizer/"></a>

<strong>System Requirements</strong>:  I've used Gibberizer only on my Windows computer.  As far as I know, this will also work on any Mac or Linux computer, as the computer has a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 5.0 or later.  My understanding is that OS X comes with JRE 5.0 pre-installed.  If your computer doesn't already have a JRE installed, you can get <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp">the latest JRE from Sun Microsystems</a>.  If you try Gibberizer on Linux or a Mac, let me know how it goes.
<strong>To run Gibberizer</strong>, just download the file and double-click it.
