title: The CwD Shuffle
---

I've transferred Conversations with Dale (CwD) from my homegrown blogging system to WordPress.  And I've split it into four blogs.

<!--more--> <strong>New Blogs.</strong>  I've split CwD into four blogs, each focused on a single topic.  CwD will remain focused on leadership.

The new blogs are:
<ul>
	<li><a href="/">dalecoding</a></li>
	<li><a href="/">daletesting</a></li>
	<li><a href="/">dalewriting</a></li>
</ul>
I'm going to assume that the names tell you enough about the topics.

<strong>New URLs and Moved Pages.</strong>  In transferring into WordPress I made several significant changes in the URLs.  In each case, I've arranged for your old links to redirect to the new locations, so that yor links still work.
<ul>
	<li>Several pages moved from CwD to the new blogs.</li>
	<li>The URLs for the posts no longer end in .html.</li>
	<li>The feeds now come from <a href="http://www.feedburner.com">FeedBurner</a>.</li>
</ul>
If you notice any problems with the links or feeds, please let me know.

<strong>No More Summary Feed.</strong>  Those of you who subscribed to the summary feed will see now see full posts.  I haven't been able to figure out how to make a summary feed <em>and</em> a full-post feed with WordPress.
